# PersonKanban

A lightweight personal Kanban board for everyday use.

It is currently a barely working Alpha project. It is more of a concept project than a fully working project at the moment.

It is built using [Wails 2](wails.io) and [Go](golang.org). Once they are installed on your system, you can run it using:

```sh 
wails dev
```

To run the developmental environment. To make a full binary build, you need to run:

```sh
wails build
```

Just remember, this is alpha quality software at the moment. Use at your own risk.
